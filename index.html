                <h1>Welcome,</h1>
                <p>My name is Sammy, a software developer. I'm an adaptable, creative individual with a passion for teamwork, event organisation, and problem-solving.
                    I have developed strong skills in maths and computing, having finished a degree in Computer Science
                    and A-levels in Further Maths. 
                    <br><br>
                    Iâ€™m currently learning new tools and
                    software, and completing projects to consolidate my skills. With experience in managing projects,
                    communicating effectively, and working under pressure, I am eager to bring my attention to detail and
                    technical abilities into any role I undertake.</p>
